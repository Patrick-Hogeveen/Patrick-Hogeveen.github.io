Hello my name is Patrick Hogeveen I am a computer science student at the university of Toronto Mississauga Campus (Obviously). I'm not a very good writer by any stretch of the imagination so I am hoping to improve that this semester. I suppose anything computer science related wouldn't be a very interesting fact as this is a computer science class. In that case I guess something interesting about me is that I used to be a runner but when university started my motivation to run dropped to an all time low. Hopefully I can meet some people who also like to run during this course.

I find many things interesting but most prominent would be computer science, I find the many unique and interesting things you can do with not only coding but the principles, algorithms and problem solving behind it to be fascinating. As a kid I always wanted to know how things worked I would disassemble my toys and various other things to get a look inside. Computers were the first thing that baffled me as I had no idea how a tiny box could do all the things it could. Many people have no clue how computers work (I barely do) and what computer scientists do is almost magic to most. This is what hooked me on computer science.

My goals during university would be to learn as much as possible about my field as it will no doubt come in use not only in the job world but also to build and create projects on my own. My goals after university would be to first find a job that makes a lot of money as I personally like to survive. But I also want to work somewhere that would afford me to opportunity to work on/ build projects I find interesting and enjoy.

I usually need help from others to spot my mistake as I'm the kind of person who accidentally drops a minus sign in a math equation and can't find where they went wrong. I hope I can help others with creative solutions to problems as I may not be good with small details but I think I'm good at coming up with broad solutions to problems although that remains to be seen by all of you.
