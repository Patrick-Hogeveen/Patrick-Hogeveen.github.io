  One of if not my favorite public speaker is Clifford Stoll an American born astronomer who has led a very interesting life. I happened upon a video of him on the youtube channel numberphile where he showcases his massive collection of klein bottles. A klein bottle being a representation of a shape that is supposed to only have one side. He seems to dabble in a variety of scientific fields from topology to computer science and just about anything else he finds interesting. 

  While he features in a few youtube videos he also does public speaking and he's even done his own ted talk. I find all of his talks incredibly entertaining for what I think are two important things he possesses. 

  One is that he is incredibly high energy he bounces from top to topic and always makes what he talks about fun and engaging. He is always eager to explain what he is doing to the audience as he wants us to be just as excited about the topic at hand as he is.

  Number two is that he generally finds what he is talking about interesting. No matter the topic from Jupiter to the speed of sound. Whatever he talks about he finds fascinating and it really shows. This would probably feed into my first reason for liking his talks. If you genuinely enjoy something it would be a lot easier to be excited about it.
