There are two projects that come to mind as my favorite and the ones I am most proud of. Both are computer related which must come as a big shock. The first would be when I built my first computer, unsurprisingly I loved playing video games so it made sense to try something of that nature. The second would be my eleventh grade final programming project, building minesweeper. 

	Building a computer was both fun and extremely stressful, an odd mix to be sure. I love to build things so constructing something so seemingly complex was something I was very proud of. Looking back now, building a computer is more or less just putting together a very expensive jigsaw puzzle. I watched a whole load of build your own computer videos online and was extremely prepared. Computer parts are very easily damaged, especially the CPU, so installing that ranks pretty high on my list of mentally taxing moments. The whole experience was very rewarding and I am hoping to do it again when my current desktop needs replacing.

	Building a minesweeper game was quite a challenge, especially in grade eleven. Making the game requires knowledge of recursion in order to check the surrounding squares for mines. They donâ€™t teach you this in grade eleven but our teacher taught our group and another group that wanted to try their hands at making minesweeper. Not only was this project difficult but it required going above and beyond our abilities and learning more. It took us a while to fully understand the recursive part and then even longer to implement it and finish the game. But in the end it worked perfectly (not that any of us were very good at minesweeper!)

	Both projects required learning a lot of new things so I think both benefited me in the long run. Not only that, they were both challenging in their own ways. Building a computer requires a lot of research, especially on your first try. Making a game as complex as minesweeper required not only the learning of new material but its application in the actual coding of the game. I find looking back I am proud of completing both of these projects.
